In this project, we will operate under the assumption that we've recently joined a renowned global IT and business consulting services firm, celebrated for its IT solution expertise and a team of seasoned IT consultants. To maintain our competitive edge and stay abreast of evolving technologies, our organization routinely conducts data analyses to anticipate future skill requisites.

In our capacity as Data Analysts, we have been entrusted with supporting this endeavor. Our primary responsibility involves aggregating data from diverse sources and pinpointing emerging skill trends for this year's report.

Our initial undertaking entails sourcing the most sought-after programming skills from a range of outlets, encompassing job postings, training portals, and surveys.

Once we've amassed a sufficient dataset, we will commence the data analysis phase, unearthing valuable insights and discerning prevailing trends.

This repository comprises various notebooks, each detailing a distinct stage of the data analysis process, along with supplementary files to facilitate comprehension.
